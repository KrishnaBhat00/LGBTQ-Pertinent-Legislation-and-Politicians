# LGBTQ-Pertinent-Legislation-and-Politicians

Project to get data on LGBTQ related legislation as well as state level politicans in potentially every state.
Scrapes laws from ACLU: https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country and politician data from ballotpedia: https://ballotpedia.org
Originally started summer 2021, made for Arkansas, currently updating for Texas in 2022.
billparse.py no longer needed because ACLU fixed their site.
