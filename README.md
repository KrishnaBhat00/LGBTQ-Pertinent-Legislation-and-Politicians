# LGBTQ-Pertinent-Legislation-and-Politicians

Project to get data on LGBTQ related legislation as well as state level politicans in potentially every state.
Scrapes laws from ACLU: https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbtq-rights-across-country and politician data from ballotpedia: https://ballotpedia.org
Originally started summer 2021, made for Arkansas, updated for Texas.

Project is currently abandoned. May come back and make the ballotpedia scraper better (although they have an API). ACLU is unnecessary because they made the website better.
The main things needed would be command line functionality and hopefully automating fixing names better.
